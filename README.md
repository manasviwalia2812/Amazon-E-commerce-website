# Amazon E-commerce Website
A JavaScript-based application that dynamically renders a grid of products, allowing users to search for products, view product details, add or remove products to a cart, place orders, and even track their shipment.

**The code uses various JavaScript concepts, such as:**

* Importing and exporting modules  
* Using template literals to generate HTML  
* Event listeners for handling user interactions (e.g., search input, button clicks)  
* DOM manipulation to update the page dynamically  
* Array methods (e.g., forEach, includes) to process data  
* Backend API requests to load products  
* Handling API responses from the backend API, parsing JSON data, and updating the page accordingly
